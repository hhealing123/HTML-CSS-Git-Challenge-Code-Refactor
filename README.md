# Module-1-Challenge

## Description: 

This assignment is about refactoring codes for the Horiseon website. By doing refactoring it allows the previous codes more efficient, as well as making application's CSS selectors and properties to be more consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

## Steps that I took to refactor:
* Clone and pull the starter code: [Link to the Starter Code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram)
* Added descriptive title, as well as revised the existing tags to more semantic tags 
  * Example: I changed several <div> tags to <article> tags.
* Added <alt> to <img> tag in case the img doesn't load.
* Commented HTML and CSS to provide more context to why refactor was needed.
