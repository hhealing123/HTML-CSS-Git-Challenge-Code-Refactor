# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This assignment is about refactoring codes for the Horiseon website. Refactoring allows the previous codes to be more efficient, as well as making application's CSS/HTML selectors and properties to be more consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure without changing its original functionality.

## Steps taken to refactor
* Clone and pull the starter code: [Link to the Starter Code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram).
* Added descriptive title, as well as revised the existing tags to more semantic tags. 
  * Example I: Changed several div tags to article tags.
  * Example II: Changed div tag to nav tag to allow navigating to different contents of the webpage.
  * Example III: Changed div tag to footer tag which allowed better flow of the webpage adjustment. 
* Added alt inside the img tag in case the img is broken or does not load.
* Added linebreaks and altered padding size to get to the final result of the webpage look. 
* Grouped classes in HTML that had same styles code in CSS.
  * Example: Changed the following classes: "benefit-lead", "benefit-brand", and "benefit-cost" to one class - "benefits-article" since the three classes shares the same styles.
* Commented HTML and CSS to provide more context to why refactor was needed.

## Challenges that I went through for the code refactoring
* Replacing existing tags to more semantic tags; I had to do some research on which tag would be more appropriate.
  * For example, div vs article vs section tags.
* Using correct class tags and improvising CSS codes.
  * I had to carefully read CSS codes to identify codes that had same styles.
* Creating my own repository to push this refactor challenge.
  * I had to go to office hour and watch couple youtube vidoes to understand how to commit and push the files to repository that I created, as well as deploying the challenge to live URL.
